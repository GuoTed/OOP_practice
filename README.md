# OOP Practice

## Encapsulation
Pack data and method into class so that users can call the interface to achieve their goals.

## Inheritance
Get properties from base class such as members, functions, friends.

## Polymorphism
`Overriding` allows users to call interface provided by a base class and execute the derieved version in runtime.
`Overloading` allows users to call the same interface with different arugs.
