# OOP Practice

## Encapsulation
Pack data and method into class so that users can call the interface to achieve their goals.

## Inheritance
Get properties from base class such as members, functions, friends.

## Polymorphism
Allow users to call interface provided by a base class and execute the derieved version in runtime. (overriding)
Allow users to call the same interface with different arugs. (overloading)
